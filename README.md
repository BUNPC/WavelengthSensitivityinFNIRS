# WavelengthSensitivityinFNIRS
This repository includes code to estimate the fluence change in fNIRS measurements for different wavelengths.

V1_SingleCompartment.zip: include code to estimate the fluence change using a single compartment model for the hemodynamic reponses to neural activation. The main.m code will generate a figure of the fluence change vs. time vs. wavelength.
V2_TowCompartment.zip: include code to estimate the fluence change using a single compartment model for the hemodynamic reponses to neural activation. The main.m code will generate a figure of the fluence change vs. time vs. wavelength.
